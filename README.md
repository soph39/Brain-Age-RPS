This is a rock paper scissors game based off a minigame from Brain Age for the Nintendo DS. I grew up with a hand-me-down DS from my cousin and Brain Age was one of my favorite games. I figured I'd try and recreate the rock paper scissors minigame but instead of saying rock paper or scissors, the player will simply make the pose with their hand.
